## About Project

This project is a start-up mock website to demonstrate the fundamental skills associated with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5. 

The header contains a navbar with a nav-brand that is responsive. When the screen size reaches tablet size and smaller the navbar collapses into a hamburger menu making the site more mobile friendly. 

The Title Section has a pinkish background color contrasted by the white text and a image rotated. This section also responds to screen size changes by rotating the image upright and moving it underneath the text in a mobile friendly way. 

Following this is the Feature Section with a white background to show the difference in sections alternating between a colored background and a white. The text is dark in color to allow for contrast with the images and text being centred and spaced appropriately. 

Next we have the Pricing Section that comprises of 3 cards created using bootstrap library. These are then centred and made responsive to allow for that mobile first approach to stay consistent throughout. 

We finish with the Call To Action and Footer sections that follow similar design principles as the Title section to bring a cohesive and closing feel to the website.
